### AI 102 Practice Assessment notes
- Key: Know stages of indexing: Document cracking, field mapping, skillset execution, and output field mapping
- Document cracking is the process of opening files and extracting content. It is the first stage of the indexing process.  Text-based content can be extracted from files in a service, rows in a table, or items in a container or collection. If you add a skillset and image skills, document cracking can also extract images and queue them for image processing.

- Cog Services-Speaker recognition
	- KEY: Read on voice profiles; note data retention, regions, languages, enrollment/signature.  Text-independent verification means that speakers can speak in everyday language in enrollment and verification phases. This is the voice profile that should be used when configuring a voice profile for the app.  Text-dependent verification means that speakers need to choose the same passphrase to use during both enrollment and verification phases.  Speaker identification helps you determine an unknown speaker’s identity within a group of enrolled speakers.

- Azure Cognitive Services-Speech apps
	- recognizing intent and entities of user utterances in real-time.  Key: phrase is like  items/phrases in a catalog.  List Entity using strict mode was better than regex entity using strict mode due to the catalog vs a pattern. The List entity is made up of a list of phrases that will guide the engine on how to match the text. When an entity has an ID of type List and is in Strict mode, the engine will only match if the text in the slot appears in the list.

	- https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/transcribe-speech-input-text/
	- Pattern Matching Vs Language Understanding.  Apps that recognize the intent and entities of user utterances in real-time. Doing simple pattern matching: The only option is to use pattern matching over Language Understanding when you want to strictly match what a user said, as the incorrect options are only available in Language Understanding.
	- [How to recognize intents with custom entity pattern matching - Azure AI services | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/speech-service/how-to-use-custom-entity-pattern-matching?tabs=jre%2Cwindows%2Cubuntu%2Cmaven&pivots=programming-language-csharp) Key: See when to use pattern matching.
	
- Speech Services-Batch Transcription
	- Using Azure Batch to process.  Cheapest storage in this case is Azure Storage as it's the default with Batch.  ADLS is interesting but not default so its not DataLake.
	- [Create a batch transcription - Speech service - Azure AI services | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/speech-service/batch-transcription-create?pivots=speech-cli)
	- [Create speech-enabled apps with Azure AI services - Training | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/transcribe-speech-input-text/)

- AI Services-Document Translation
	- AI translator does documents from one language to another.  Features in the translator service: (Detect language, Dictionary lookup, Transliterate)
	- [What is Azure Text Translation? - Azure AI services | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/translator/text-translation-overview)
	- [Translate text with the Translator service - Training | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/translate-text-with-translator-service/)
	- [Frequently asked questions - Document Translation - Azure AI services | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/translator/document-translation/faq)
	- ; Read: formats that render best results.  Don't encrypt your PDFs. Common problem. Text in an image are NOT translated.  BLEU score of 40-60 considered High Quality.  Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU).  PRECISION is metric for measuring model accuracy of CLU.  Precision measures how precise/accurate a model is. It is the ratio between the correctly identified positives (true positives) and all identified positives. The precision metric reveals how many of the predicted classes are correctly labeled.

- AI Services-custom translation
	- Custom translation model for bilingual training documents should use a LIBERAL rule.
	- ; Any in-domain human translation is better than machine translation. Add and remove documents as you go and try to improve the Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score.
	- [Custom Translator for beginners - Azure AI services | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/translator/custom-translator/beginners-guide#what-should-i-use-for-training-material)
	

Be strict is incorrect. Compose them to be optimally representative of what you are going to translate in the future. Be restrictive is also incorrect. A phrase dictionary is case-sensitive, and any word or phrase listed is translated in the way you specify. In many cases, it is better to not use a phrase dictionary and let the system learn.

Recall measures the model's ability to predict actual positive classes. F1 score is a function of precision and recall. BLEU is from the Azure AI Translator service.

	- Performance-multilingual conversational app using conversational language understanding (CLU); add utterances for poor performing languages.  With CLU, there is no need to use multiple projects for a model. For example, you can train a model in English and query it in German. There is no project language, therefore, adding utterances for languages in the model that are performing poorly is the appropriate solution to increase performance.
	- [Multilingual projects - Azure AI services | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/language-service/conversational-language-understanding/concepts/multiple-languages)

	- https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/build-language-understanding-model/

- Cognitive Services-Active learning
	- Note: there is a 30m delay time, latency
	- Active learning suggestions are NOT REAL-TIME. There is an approximate delay of 30 minutes before suggestions show on the pane. This delay balances the high cost involved in real-time updates to the index and service performance.  Active learning is turned ON by default. You can use active learning for this instead of manually logging the questions and adding them.  That would NOT be least administrative effort. Stupid trick questions.  Right thing to do is NOTHING just wait 30 minutes. BS that's wrong in my book.

	- ; When training the model, you should avoid repeating an identical sentence multiple times, as it may create bias against the rest of the input.  You should avoid including uncommon symbols (~, # @ % &), as they will be discarded. The sentences in which they appear will also be discarded.  You should also avoid putting inputs that are too large, such as hundreds of thousands of sentences, because doing so will dilute the effect of boosting.
	- include multiple examples, provide adaption options, put only one sentence per line

- Cognitive Services-AI Vision Image Analysis "adult content" scenario
	- The **Azure AI Vision Image Analysis** service can extract a wide variety of visual features from an images. One of them is to detect adult content.

- Cognitive Services-Configuration
	- AI Custom Vision, app is deployed to Azure VM, firewall rules for AI services account is set. Ensure access through a service endpoint
	- ; If you enable the firewall for the Azure AI Services account, you need to allow network access to the service. You can achieve this by either allowing access from a specific virtual network or adding an IP range to the firewall rules. In this situation, the app is deployed to a virtual machine in Azure, which resides in a virtual network. You can provide access to virtual networks in Azure to access specific service endpoints.  Grant access to the virtual network.
